# AeoFit-Case-Study

About AeroFit:
AeroFit is a leading brand in the fitness equipment industry, offering a wide range of products to cater to the diverse needs of health-conscious individuals. Their product portfolio includes treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and various fitness accessories.  Among their core offerings are three distinct treadmills: the KP281, KP481, and KP781.

KP281: This entry-level treadmill is priced at $1,500 and caters to individuals starting their fitness journey or those with limited space requirements.
KP481: The KP481 is a mid-range treadmill priced at $1,750, targeting mid-level runners seeking a balance between features and affordability.
KP781: The top-of-the-line KP781 treadmill boasts advanced features and functionalities, priced at $2,500, ideal for serious runners and fitness enthusiasts.


Problem Statement:

The market research team at AeroFit identified a gap in their current approach to customer recommendations. While they offer a variety of treadmills, they lack a clear understanding of the specific customer profiles associated with each product.  This presents a challenge in effectively guiding potential buyers towards the treadmill that best aligns with their fitness goals and budget.

Objective:

● Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill
product by developing appropriate tables and charts.

● Construct two-way contingency tables for each AeroFit treadmill product and compute
all conditional and marginal probabilities and their insights/impact on the business.

Approach:

I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Aerofit treadmill customer dataset. My goal was to identify customer profiles for each treadmill type. I achieved this by analyzing characteristics like age, income, and usage patterns. Through visualizations and descriptive statistics, I segmented customers based on their preferences and potential purchase behavior. This information can be used by Aerofit to provide better product recommendations and improve customer targeting.
